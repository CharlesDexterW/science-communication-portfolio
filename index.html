  <p id="article-summary">In Ecuadorean culture, it is very common to hear mom's good old phrase "you better go get yourself a coat, else you'll catch a cold". People would usually rush back home and do so. But, does cold weather really make us sick? Let's find out.
</p>

  <p>The onset of common these ailments is attributed to germs. Several types of viruses are responsible for colds, https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(03)12162-9/fulltext while the influenza virus is the culprit behind the flu. Conditions such as pneumonia, ear infections, and sinusitis originate from both virus or bacteria. The infection of these microscopic organisms leads to the seasonal surge in these illnesses. 

Viruses are extremely small organisms made up of DNA or RNA and protein envelop that float around looking for their next host (a specific cell type, like lung cells) to take advantage of their reproduction mechanism. In other words, viruses are microscopic parasites that hijack a cell to make copies of themselves, usually adapting to the host's current conditions in the process. This infection is what produces the symptoms of the common cold and th "flu".

Bacteria are single cell organisms found almost everywhere. Some of them may cause illnesses by growing in the infection site while many others live in symbiosis within us.
