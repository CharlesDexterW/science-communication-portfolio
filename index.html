  <p id="article-summary">In Ecuadorean culture, it is very common to hear mom's good old phrase "you better go get yourself a coat, else you'll catch a cold". People would usually rush back home and do so. But, does cold weather really make us sick? Let's find out.
</p>

  <p>The onset of common these ailments is attributed to germs. Several types of viruses are responsible for colds, https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(03)12162-9/fulltext while the influenza virus is the culprit behind the flu. Conditions such as pneumonia, ear infections, and sinusitis originate from both virus or bacteria. The infection of these microscopic organisms leads to the seasonal surge in these illnesses. 

Viruses are extremely small organisms made up of DNA or RNA and protein envelop that float around looking for their next host (a specific cell type, like lung cells) to take advantage of their reproduction mechanism. In other words, viruses are microscopic parasites that hijack a cell to make copies of themselves, usually adapting to the host's current conditions in the process. This infection is what produces the symptoms of the common cold and th "flu".

Bacteria are single cell organisms found almost everywhere. Some of them may cause illnesses by growing in the infection site while many others live in symbiosis within us.

## So, what does weather have to do with a virus infection? 

According to a study, cold weather is a direct initiating factor of the common cold, as it reduces mucus secretion that catches outer invaders before they reach their favorite spot to begin the infection. https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-024-1713-5_5

There's also a high chance that a radical weather change can weaken the immune system, thus, making it vulnerable to viral and bacterial infections. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1016/j.wem.2011.08.005 

However, there are other factors related to cold weather such as crowding, sociability and stress. Since cold weather may make the people concentrate in closed places, https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/falgy.2023.1224988/full you would be rather safer outside of supermarkets and other crowded places, away from virus and bacteria carriers. Social people tend to meet with their friends more often than introverts, which makes them get more exposed to [[contagions]], and [[stress]] is known to weaken or [[immune response]].

some people are more susceptible to harsh climate and its variations than others and this is due to their [[genetics]] and growing conditions. Basically, if your ancestry comes from people who lived in cold weather for most of their lives, it's likely that your body will quickly adapt to cold temperatures and its sudden changes without getting sick in the process. https://www.cell.com/trends/genetics/fulltext/S0168-9525(20)30070-6?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0168952520300706%3Fshowall%3Dtrue


Overall, while cold weather may contribute to make you sick, virus and bacteria are the only real responsible of such diseases. So be sure to take a coat with you, specialty if you live in the mountain region.
