                Antibiotics, once a miracle cure, have revolutionized medicine. However, the overuse and misuse of these drugs have led to a growing crisis: antibiotic resistance. Bacteria are constantly evolving and developing resistance to the very antibiotics designed to kill them. This allows them to survive and multiply, leading to serious infections that are increasingly difficult to treat.

                 <p>
                The human lifespan almost doubled after the discovery and medical application of antibiotics. Since then, most bacterial infections have turned from a life-threatening hazard to a mid-week work schedule inconvenience. However, bacteria have been enduring medical treatment and delaying each healing process more and more during the last twenty years. Are they adapting to our pharmaceutical arsenal? How are they doing it, and what can we do to avoid its consequences?

                As we have previously discussed, bacteria are tiny; microscopical unicellular beings that live almost everywhere, including our body. Some of them become a nuisance to our health when they get to populate organs and tissues they're not supposed to. Antibiotics are the tools other natural organisms produce to dispose of bacteria and secure their resources. In response, bacteria have been shown to develop resistance to said natural weapons, triggering a biological warfare that apparently began way before the dawn of mankind. And, believe it or not, the scientific community has been warning us about the ongoing <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4378521/" target="_blank">Antibiotic Resistance Crisis</a> since the 1960s.
                 </p>

                 <p>
                 Bacteria develop antibiotic resistance over time, even within a year, through <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK216503/#:~:text=Bacteria%20with%20either%20natural%20or,in%20which%20antibiotics%20are%20used." target="_blank">diverse mechanisms</a>. These mechanisms are natural selection processes like random mutations of their genetic material, and survival of the fittest, where only the antibiotic-resistant bacteria get to reproduce. Bacteria are also able to share antibiotic resistance genes with other bacteria by exchanging tiny circular gene packets named plasmids, a process known as <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9314185/#:~:text=The%20plasmids%20carrying%20carbapenemase%20resistance,be%20rapidly%20transmitted%20to%20other" target="_blank">horizontal gene transfer</a>.
                 </p>

                 <p>We use antibiotics more than you know. A common issue is their over-prescription in the public and private health systems. Besides, we currently use antibiotics in food production to keep dairy and meat products sterile and fit for safe consumption. they're also used to treat <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559438/#:~:text=Antibiotics%20are%20used%20as%20growth,humans%2C%20animals%2C%20and%20plants." target="_blank">plant infections and keep crops healthy</a>. As a consequence, medical treatments are slowly taking longer to succeed, since it takes more time to identify the proper antibiotic for each bacterial infection. Medical surgeries will be more at risk of bacterial contamination and both situations are increasing healthcare costs worldwide. Ultimately, some bacteria have become immune to almost all antibiotics, rendering severe bacterial infections like <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/hcp/clinical-overview/drug-resistant-tuberculosis-disease.html#:~:text=Multidrug%2Dresistant%20TB%20(MDR%20TB,most%20effective%20first%2Dline%20TB" target="_blank">Tuberculosis</a> hardly treatable by current antibiotics.
                 </p>

                <p>
                    However, there's hope for all of us. Scientists and medical care professionals are looking at other <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8868457/#:~:text=Considering%20the%20global%20health%20impact,and%20treat%20MDR%2C%20XDR%2C%20and" target="_blank">alternatives</a> to the use of antibiotics to fight bacterial infections, such as a therapy focused in bacteria-infecting viruses, use of nano-particles and even other bacteria. But, what can we as citizens do to slow down the development of antibiotic resistance? We could stop using antibiotics so recklessly. <a href="https://www.who.int/activities/optimizing-selection-and-use-of-antimicrobial-medicines" target="_blank">Responsible use of antibiotics</a> involves avoiding their use unless it's strictly necessary, completing the full course of our antibiotic prescription, and never sharing our antibiotics unless they match other people's prescriptions. Take some <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7165117/#:~:text=If%20implemented%20effectively%2C%20home%20and,need%20for%20antibiotic%20prescriptions%2C%20thereby" taret="_blank">preventive measures</a>, like washing your hands with soap and water regularly, and following food safety guidelines to avoid food-borne illnesses. Bigger measures like switching the common protein source production and avoiding the antibiotic use in agriculture would be more effective, but the won't be possible unless these changes are pushed through environmental and health policies or a complete change in the product demand.
