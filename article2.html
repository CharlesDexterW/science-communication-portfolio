                 This article delves into the latest research on Alzheimer's, exploring the role of proteins like amyloid plaques and tau tangles in disrupting brain function. It also discusses promising new treatments, including a groundbreaking peptide that has shown potential in protecting against neurodegeneration. While there is no cure yet, understanding the risk factors and staying informed about emerging therapies offers hope for managing and potentially preventing this debilitating disease.

                 <p><a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/what-alzheimers-disease" target="_blank">Alzheimer's sisease</a> is a neurological disorder that affects the brain, which leads to a progressive decline in memory, thinking capacity and behavior. It's currently the most common cause of dementia.. Some of the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease include having a hard time remembering recent events, having trouble completing familiar chores and misplacing items. Progressively, these symptoms worsen and the individual experiences confusion, memory loss, difficulty communicating and strong mood changes. Ultimately, Alzheimer's disease renders the affected unable to complete the simplest tasks like chewing, swallowing and breathing.</p>

                    The precise causes of Alzheimer's disease are still being studied. The <a href="https://www.termedia.pl/Review-article-What-causes-alzheimer-s-disease-,20,21432,1,1.html" target="_blank">current understanding</a> of the disease suggests it's most likely due to brain changes. Alzheimer's disease is physically recognized by the accumulation of two abnormal proteins in the brain: amyloid plates and tau tangles. It's believed these proteins are able to disrupt communication between neurons and lead to their eventual death, which causes the symptoms mentioned above. We aren't sure why these proteins are formed yet. But we have currently identified a series of factors which are involved in the disease's development. Some of the most important factors are genetics and environmental factors.</p>

                 <p>We have found that there's a strong correlation between Alzheimer's and sleep disorders and we strongly suspect sleep disorders are one of the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/40/1/zsw032/2661823" target="_blank">main causatives</a> for Alzheimer's during old age. The national institute of aging, along the Alzheimer's Institute and the CDC recommend engaging in exercise, maintaining a healthy diet and avoiding alcohol and drugs to reduce the risk of dementia during old age.</p> 
                 <p>Alzheimer's disease has no cure yet. Its symptoms' development may only be delayed through the use of certain drugs which may not be available for all the people. However, ongoing research has yielded a better understanding of the disease. One of the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37043533/" target="_blank">latest studies</a> has found that an enzyme identified as cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), which is very common in the brain as it is involved in several cellular processes including neuronal migration and survival, may play an important role in the development of Alzheimer's disease by promoting the formation of tau tangles and amyloid plates. Knowing this allowed a team of researchers from MIT to engineer a nameless peptide which has shown to provide protection against neurodegeneration in several models. This, and other novel treatments may improve the expectancy of Alzheimer's patients.</p>
