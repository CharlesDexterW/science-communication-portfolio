                 <p id="article-summary">In Ecuadorean culture, it is very common to hear mom's good old phrase "you better go get yourself a coat, else you'll catch a cold", even when it's a sunny day. Despite the sunshine, some people would still rush back home and do so. But, does cold weather really make us sick? Let's find out.
                 </p>

                 <p>According to a <a href="https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1096/fasebj.29.1_supplement.571.2" target="_blank">study</a>,cold weather reduces our nose and throat's mucus secretion which in turn makes us vulnerable to develop any of a wide variety of respiratory diseases from the <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-024-1713-5_5" target="_blank">common cold</a> to other more threatening ones like pneumonia. The onset of these ailments is actually attributed to virus and bacteria. Several types of <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(03)12162-9/fulltext" target="_blank">viruses</a> are responsible for colds, while the influenza virus is the culprit behind the flu. Conditions such as pneumonia, ear infections, and sinusitis originate from both virus or bacteria. Viruses are extremely small organisms made up of DNA or RNA molecules and a protein envelop, some float around looking for their next host to hijack its cells and make copies of themselves, usually adapting to the host's current conditions in the process. This process is what produces the symptoms of every respiratory infection such as the common cold and the "flu". <a href="https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/brock-biology-of-microorganisms/P200000006867/9780135860717)" target="_blank">Bacteria</a> are single cell organisms found almost everywhere. Some of them may cause illnesses by growing in the infection site while many others live in symbiosis within us. Whenever they get to populate a tissue, such as our throats, where they don't belong to, they end up making us sick.

                 <p>Other contributing <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/falgy.2023.1224988/full" target="_blank">factors</a> that might give virus and bacteria a chance to infect us are crowding, sociability and stress, which are loosely related to the seasonal weather, since it may make the people concentrate in closed spaces due to social events such holiday gatherings and others. Alongside are our <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32396835/" target="_blank">genetics and growing conditions</a>. By default, some people are more susceptible to harsh climate and its variations than others and this is due to their.

                 <p>All in all, while virus and bacteria are the direct responsible of giving us the cold and other more serious illnesses, it's the cold weather and other factors such as our genetics and human social behavior that could let all those tiny organisms into out body. But we can take measures to avoid infecting people and getting infected. We could use face masks when entering crowded places, specially during peak flu seasons, or completely avoid them unless necessary, and of course, bring a coat with us when going out, just like mom said. </p>
